          AI & ML Enthusiast | Full-Stack Developer | Django, SQL, Python
        </h2>

        <p className="about-text">
          I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer passionate about building
          scalable and user-friendly web applications. With hands-on experience
          in Django, SQL, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, I enjoy developing solutions that are both efficient and
          intuitive.
          <br />
          <br />
          My focus is on real-time, responsive appsâ€”like a resume builder using
          Django + SQL Server. I strive to write clean, maintainable code and
          continually learn modern practices. My goal is to contribute to
          impactful tech projects and evolve into a well-rounded developer.
